# About Me👨‍💻
I'm Jimmy, a senior studying Information Engineering at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), and although I'm not very good at coding, I do enjoy it! Whenever I succeed in completing a function or a screen that I have imagined in my head using my own code, I get a great sense of accomplishment!
